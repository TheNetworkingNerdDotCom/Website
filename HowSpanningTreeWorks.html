    <h2>How Spanning Tree Protocol works</h2>

    <div>By now, it should be obvious that we really don't want loops in our networks. We know Spanning Tree Protocol is
      perfect for eliminating loops, but how exactly does it work?</div>

    <div class="break">There are three IEEE standards of Spanning Tree Protocol:</div>

    <ul>
      <li>Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) - 802.1D</li>
      <li>Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) - 802.1w</li>
      <li>Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) - 802.1s</li>
    </ul>

    <div>This section is going to focus on the fundamentals of STP. The differences between STP, RSTP, and MSTP will be
      explained in the next section.</div>

    <div class="break">We are going to look at another scenario: Two switches connected by two links, with a PC
      connected to each switch. The network engineer who designed this network wanted to build in redundency, if one of
      the links were to fail, traffic could continue to flow between the switches and PCs.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <p>Given this scenario, why would we need STP here?</p>
